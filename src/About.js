                Since I began coding in school, my love and knowledge for web development have continuously grown. 
                I’m always eager to learn new things about coding. I enjoy using different programs and various 
                coding methods to accomplish my personal and professional tasks. The most rewarding part of coding for me, 
                aside from completing or perfect, is helping others expand and improve their business’. 
                I’m a confident, tenacious person who strongly believes that hard work pays off. My curious nature always
                 drives me to learn new things and improve my skills for my future career.
